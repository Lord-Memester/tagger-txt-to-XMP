# TXT to XMP Sidecar Script

This script takes a plaintext list of comma-separated tags relevant to an image (mine were generated by [this plugin](https://github.com/picobyte/stable-diffusion-webui-wd14-tagger.git) for [Automatic1111's Stable Diffusion Web UI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui.git)) and turns it into an XMP sidecar file by creating an XML file with the reformatted contents. It is intended for use with [Immich](https://github.com/immich-app/immich), but it may be useful in other programs as well.

## Usage

```bash
python txt-to-xmp-sidecar.py -i <input_directory>
```

* `-i`: Optional. Used to specify the input directory containing the `.txt` files. If unspecified, uses an "in" folder if found in the same directory as the python script. Otherwise yells at you. I hope.
